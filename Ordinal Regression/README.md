# Ordinal Regression with Markov Longitudinal Model

This [R walkthrough](https://BerryConsultants.github.io/code-libraries/Ordinal%20Regression/ordinal_regression.html) guides through data generation, prior calibration and posterior simulation for an ordinal regression model with a Markov longitudinal model to impute the final endpoints using prior visit values.

Highlights from this walkthrough include: 

* Review of ordinal regression models
* Frequentist and Bayesian model fitting techniques
* Markov longitudinal model
* Alluvial plots to visualize longitudinal models
* Matrix plots to visualize transition probability matrices
